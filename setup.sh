#   ./setup.sh                        # interactive mode
#   ./setup.sh --non-interactive      # all defaults + auto-detect
#   ./setup.sh --domain octo.example.com --ip 1.2.3.4 --https --summary

# the manual health poll already runs at `up` time. Previously
# `--verify` only grep-ed for `(unhealthy)`, so a service that had

# naming is `<project>-<service>-<replica>`, e.g.
# `octo-preflight-1` / `octo-minio-init-1`, so we anchor on

# long-running service is *still* a failure here, because none of the
# non-one-shot services should ever exit voluntarily — that case is
# caught by the broader `Exited \([1-9]` clause (a service that exits

Smoke test / tear-down (work against an already-existing docker/.env):
  --verify            Probe nginx / octo-server / matter / object-store
                      paths end-to-end. Exits non-zero on any failure.
  --uninstall         Tear down the stack. Interactively offers three
                      granularity levels (full / data-only / containers-only).

When any of --domain / --ip / --https / --summary / --up is given without
--non-interactive, setup.sh treats the flags as your decisions and runs
non-interactively so the documented one-liner forms (see docker/README.md)
work as written.

  # R6 (YUJ-997 / Jerry-Xin P1 W1B): WuKongIM `/ws` probe.
  #
  # Background: WuKongIM is the chat transport. Before this probe,
  # `--verify` had no way to detect that wukongim had stopped:
  # `(unhealthy)` only fires when the healthcheck has actually run and
  # failed, but a freshly stopped container disappears from the
  # `running` set and (depending on `restart:` policy) never enters
  # `unhealthy` at all. The new fatal-state check in step 1 covers
  # `Exited (1)` / `Restarting` / `Dead`, but a clean `docker stop
  # wukongim` leaves the container as `Exited (0)` and slips past
  # both. So we also probe the user-visible WS surface end-to-end:
  # nginx → wukongim:5200.
  #
  # We send a real WebSocket upgrade request (RFC 6455 §4.1 mandatory
  # headers: `Upgrade: websocket`, `Connection: Upgrade`,
  # `Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13`, base64 `Sec-WebSocket-Key`). Expected
  # responses when WuKongIM is online:
  #   - `101 Switching Protocols`  (full handshake accepted — happy)
  #   - `400 Bad Request`          (WuKongIM is up but rejected our
  #                                 partial handshake — also healthy
  #                                 evidence)
  #   - `426 Upgrade Required`     (some WuKongIM versions return this
  #                                 for non-conforming upgrades)
  # Failure signals:
  #   - `502 / 503 / 504`          (nginx reached, upstream wukongim
  #                                 absent / down)
  #   - `000`                      (connection refused / curl error)
  # Other 4xx/5xx are bucketed as failure too; safer to false-positive
  # on weird WuKongIM upgrades than to false-negative on a stopped
  # container. openssl is already a hard prereq (checked above), so the
  # base64-random WS key generation is always available.
  step "WuKongIM /ws upgrade probe (GET ${BASE_URL}/ws)"
  # R8 (YUJ-1002 / ReviewBot P0): replace curl with a python3 socket
  # probe. The R7 form looked like
  #   `WS_CODE="$(curl ... )" || WS_CODE=""`
  # and tripped over a bash quirk: the assignment's exit status is the
  # exit status of the command substitution, so `curl` returning 28
  # (max-time abort, which is *the expected outcome on a healthy
  # WuKongIM* — the 101 has no body to drain) made the `||` branch fire
  # and clobber the just-captured "101" with "". The probe then FAILED
  # on the healthy path — exactly what step 5.5 is meant to catch.
  #
  # python3 is already a hard prereq for `--verify` (the admin login
  # and presign blocks below `python3 -c 'import json'`). Speaking the
  # bare WebSocket upgrade over a raw TCP socket sidesteps both the
  # curl WS framing limitation AND the bash command-substitution
  # exit-code quirk: we read the first line of the response, parse the
  # numeric status code in python, and propagate healthy/fail purely
  # through the script's own exit code. RFC 6455 §4.1 mandatory
  # headers are still sent (`Upgrade: websocket`, `Connection: Upgrade`,
  # `Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13`, base64 `Sec-WebSocket-Key`) so a
  # well-behaved WuKongIM still answers 101.
  #
  # R9 (YUJ-1004 / Jerry-Xin + lml2468 P0-2): the assignment MUST be
  # wrapped in an `if` head. `setup.sh:19` runs under `set -euo pipefail`,
  # and per `bash(1)` "errexit" the simple-command form
  #     WS_OUT="$(python3 …)"
  # propagates the command-substitution exit status to the assignment;
  # `set -e` then immediately aborts the whole `--verify` run as soon as
  # python3 returns non-zero (i.e. the very case step 5.5 is meant to
  # report). That swallowed every downstream check — the `fail` line, the
  # `((fails++))`, the admin-login probe, the presigned-PUT probe — and
  # left `--verify` exiting 0-ish or aborting silently with no fails-count
  # summary. The `WS_STATUS=$?` line below was effectively dead code.
  # Using `if … then … else WS_STATUS=$? fi` keeps the command substitution
  # inside the "test in an if statement" exemption listed in bash(1) under
  # `set -e`, so the failing python3 is captured (not fatal), `WS_STATUS`
  # is set to the python exit code, and the rest of `--verify` proceeds
  # to run, accumulate fails, and exit non-zero with the proper summary.
  # Chosen over `… || true`: `|| true` would also mask any genuine bash
  # syntax / runtime error inside the heredoc body (e.g. a typo turning a
  # name-resolution failure into a silent pass). The explicit `if` keeps
  # the intent ("python3 exit code drives WS_STATUS, nothing more") legible.

# INCIDENT-2026-05-16-001 follow-up: the interactive preflight may
# `export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=octo-<suffix>` so the rest of THIS shell
# scopes correctly, but that export vanishes the moment the operator
# exits setup.sh. A later `cd docker && docker compose up -d --wait`
# in a fresh shell would then silently fall back to the YAML `name: octo`
# default, mount the `octo_*` volume set, and (because the project name
# now mismatches) a subsequent `setup.sh --uninstall` grep would happily
# scoop up volumes from OTHER `octo-*` stacks on the same host.
#
# Writing the value into `docker/.env` is the documented, Compose-native
# way to make project-name selection durable: Compose auto-loads `.env`
# from its project directory before reading either `name:` or the
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME shell env var, so the `up -d` from a vanilla
# shell ends up scoped to the same project this setup chose.
# R8 (YUJ-1002 / Jerry-Xin W1): mirror the `project_name()` precedence
# (shell > docker/.env > "octo") here as well. The previous form
# `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-octo}` ignored the persisted `.env` value
# and so an `./setup.sh --force` rerun from a shell that had NOT
# re-exported COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME overwrote a saved `octo-fz` with
# the default `octo` — quietly re-aliasing the stack onto the shared
# `octo_*` volume set on the next `compose up`. `read_existing_project_name`
# reads the same `.env` file the rest of the script speaks to, so the
# three layers stay in lock-step with the documented `project_name()`
# contract.
# R9 (YUJ-1004 / Jerry-Xin + lml2468 P0-1): the R8 form still re-read
# `.env` here, but by this point the template has already been installed
# over it (line 1186) so the docker/.env-side fallback resolves to the
# template literal `octo` instead of the operator's `octo-fz`. Use the
# `SAVED_PROJECT` snapshot captured *before* the template overwrite (see
# the read-before-overwrite block above) so the shell-export → previously-
# persisted-.env → "octo" precedence stays intact across `--force` reruns.
